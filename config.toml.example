# Podcast Backup Configuration
# Copy this file to config.toml and update with your settings

# ==============================================================================
# OPTION 1: Single Podcast (Simple - Backward Compatible)
# ==============================================================================
# Use this format if you're backing up just one podcast
# Also supports environment variables as fallback

# Required: URL of the podcast RSS feed to backup
#podcast_url = "https://feeds.example.com/podcast.rss"

# Required: Directory where podcast episodes will be stored
#storage_dir = "/path/to/podcast/archive"

# Required: Base URL for accessing archived files locally
# Examples:
#   - "http://archive.example.com/podcasts" (local web server)
#   - "file:///path/to/podcast/archive" (direct file access)
#base_url = "http://archive.example.com/podcasts"

# Optional: Maximum number of new episodes to download per run (default: 0)
# Values:
#   -1 = Disable all downloads (only update metadata/RSS)
#   0 = Unlimited downloads (download all available episodes)
#   Positive number = Download up to this many episodes per run
# Examples:
#   max_downloads = -1  (no downloads, metadata only)
#   max_downloads = 0   (download everything)
#   max_downloads = 5   (download up to 5 episodes)
#max_downloads = 0

# Optional: Only download episodes from the last N days (default: 0 = all)
# Values:
#   0 = Download all episodes regardless of age
#   Positive number = Only download episodes published within the last N days
# Examples:
#   days_to_download = 0   (download all episodes)
#   days_to_download = 30  (only episodes from last 30 days)
#   days_to_download = 365 (only episodes from last year)
#days_to_download = 0

# ==============================================================================
# OPTION 2: Multiple Podcasts (Recommended)
# ==============================================================================
# Use this format to backup multiple podcasts in one run
# Each podcast gets its own subdirectory under storage_dir

# Global storage directory (required for multi-podcast)
storage_dir = "/path/to/podcast/archive"

# Global defaults (optional - can be overridden per-podcast)
# max_downloads: -1 = disable downloads, 0 = unlimited, positive = download limit per run
max_downloads = 0
# days_to_download: 0 = all episodes, positive = only episodes from last N days
days_to_download = 0

# Define each podcast with [[podcasts]] array
[[podcasts]]
name = "my-podcast"  # Used as folder name: storage_dir/my-podcast/
podcast_url = "https://feeds.example.com/podcast1.rss"
# Base URL for local access (modified RSS feed will use this)
base_url = "http://archive.example.com/my-podcast"
# Optional per-podcast overrides:
# max_downloads = -1       # Disable downloads (metadata/RSS only)
# max_downloads = 0        # Unlimited downloads (download all)
# max_downloads = 5        # Download up to 5 episodes per run
# days_to_download = 365   # Only episodes from last year
# days_to_download = 0     # All episodes regardless of age
# storage_dir = "/custom/path"  # Override global storage_dir

[[podcasts]]
name = "another-podcast"
podcast_url = "https://feeds.example.com/podcast2.rss"
base_url = "http://archive.example.com/another-podcast"

# Add more podcasts as needed...
# [[podcasts]]
# name = "third-podcast"
# podcast_url = "..."
# base_url = "..."
